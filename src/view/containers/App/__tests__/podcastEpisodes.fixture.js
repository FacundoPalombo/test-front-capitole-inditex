We speculate which leads to a critique of one of the passenger’s stepsons who chose to attend a concert and message an Only Fans model. Mal defends his disdain towards stepchildren. Cardi B provided her point of view which led to a conversation about her and Tasha K. Meanwhile in Paris, Pharrell hosted his first Louis Vuitton fashion show. All the stars were out and hip-hop beef made its way to the runway. Pusha T finally responds to Jim Jones on a previewed song during the show. While old head beef continues XXL ushers this year’s freshmen class. This leads to a conversation about Ice Spice, Kim Kardashian, and Kanye. YK Osiris is back with a nasty PR move. We recall some of our favorite ridiculous moments in hip-hop PR history. Young Thug is making his return and we give our predictions and Julian calls Gunna’s first week sales. Nicki is back to beefing, but this time with Saweetie. Now it’s time to get into voicemails which continues to be a relationship segment, but this time we add a “is this hip-hop” question. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this + more!',

Demaris doubled back on Pergola, while Julian pulled up on Eddin’s DJ set. In bigger news over the weekend J. Cole is part owner of the Charlotte Hornets. Quavo and Offset are seen publicly together for the first time since the split. We give an update on the shows we are currently watching, The Idol and Black Mirror (spoilers). Meanwhile, Gunna officially comes back into the music scene with his first album post RICO. Listen for our review of the album and our theories behind why Young Thug is releasing this weekend. Did Killer Mike release the album of the year? We discuss Doja’s single and the potential her new sound will lead her. It’s time for voicemails! We return with Ja Morant’s suspension.',

Speaking of feet, Doja Cat is back with the first single off her upcoming album. Is she dissing Nicki? And will she go #1 on Billboard? That being said, hip-hop doesn’t have a #1 this year. We discuss why that might be the case. We stay on music and discuss Made in America’s female-dominant lineup and a couple other festivals. Then we get to the biggest controversy in music this week, YK Osiris. Naturally we brought up Meek’s tweets about the situation. Today’s voicemails were concerning to say the least. First, we have a Freaknik call followed by a (not hip-hop) boys trip to Miami. Finally we end the NBA season on a correct sports take. Mal and Julian said the Nuggets would win in 5. This led to an interesting discussion about Jokic. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this + more!',

Lastly on internet love, we give an update on Zion. Meanwhile in real life, Floyd Mayweather is now feuding with the notorious mafia Gotti family. Is this all staged? What wasn’t staged was Conor McGregor knocking out the Miami Heat mascot. Would you drink your girls pee? Lil Durk’s removed verse takes an interesting turn. Unfortunately, Drake’s name gets into another incident following DJ Drama getting robbed in Toronto. It’s time for voicemails. Somehow this becomes a discussion of how little Rory is attracted to white women and why Mal thinks it’s appropriate to drop moneybags on girls' IGs even if he’s in a relationship. The insecurity conversation is prime Mal. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this + more!",

Do we want to connect with people or pretend to? Zion might as well have been breathing NYC air based on his baby momma drama. Let’s talk music…in the middle of this recording Drake released a new feature. Is it too early for the song of the summer? And find out why Rory hopes nobody in R&B releases new music. And yes, we (Mal) address Azealia Banks recent comments. It’s time for voicemails. Listen to us give more amazing relationship advice along with family help. In sports news we cover Travis Rudolph, the NBA Finals, the hoax pulled by the PGA. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this + more!',

Rory has officially been initiated to the Act Bad Summer (check twitter to watch him dance on beat) We debate whether or not sign language at festivals is legit. DJ Drama decided to “make peace” with Meek during his set, while at Summer Jam, Cardi threw some shade at Ice Spice during her performance. Did Meg invent woman empowerment? and is Da Baby still canceled? Rory addresses some childhood trauma. Then Demaris asks a very odd question to the group which involves pleasure and food. Once again, Mal was right about Kanye/Adidas and Biden falls (again). Rory goes down a history conspiracy tangent, which leads us to the recently sold Epstein’s island (insert bleeps). Speaking of extreme wealth, Drake’s card gets declined on a live stream. This leads to a discussion about the dangers of gambling. Then we answer a few phone calls and play our first follow up voicemail. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this + more!',

Julian “acted bad” at the release party while Demaris was hours late. RIP to Tina Turner, but Rory (probably) felt a way based on the charts. Then Rory shares his trip to Seattle and taking his daughter to her first baseball game and aquarium. Speaking of under the sea, Mal was planning on seeing the Little Mermaid alone. Meanwhile in hip-hop the beef is back between DJ Drama and Meek / Drake and Kendrick. Then we discuss an odd dating preference from Rubi Rose. It’s time for voicemails. Today’s focus is on relationships/sex (our specialty). Finally, we discuss sports Shannon Sharpe leaving FS1, LeBron contemplating retirement, and NBA Finals prediction.

Meanwhile, Rory, aka Snow Cone, shares a gang story. Then Rory and Julian offer some insight on Greek Life. Is puberty only respected from the women’s side? The guys discuss how difficult it is to be bricked up all day with no out. Should men be allowed to become a gynecologist? This question splits the room and causes a heated debate to close out the episode. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this, as well as TI's character in ATL, parents on Only Fans, + more!",

        'Gotta start off with letting you know that the opening track is "My Phone Can Die" ft. Ari Lennox & James Fauntleroy, the latest single out of Rory\'s album that officially drops next week! This episode the crew talks about Jay-Z wanting to open a whole casino in the middle of Times Sq, and why Rick Ross doesn\'t care about permits for his future car show. Then we get into Charlamagne finally paying his d*ck debt after Adidas and Kanye start business back together. Meanwhile, J Prince meets up with NBA Young Boy while also giving him a fair warning about Drake. Timbaland is making a new program that features and highlights the use of A.I bringing back the voices of your favorite artists that have passed. As always we go through your voicemails & Mal goes through Ray Allen\'s starting five and unpacks the fact that he set Lebron as his sixth man. We also got a NEW SHOW on Patreon called "RAM RADIO", so don\'t forget to check that out over at Patreon.com/NEWRORYNMAL.',

J Cole has a line that sparks a conversation about rappers that passed. We then discuss the difficulty of bringing people up with you. Speaking of uplifting people, Lil Wayne left a show because of how people were treating his new artists. In good news, Jamie Foxx is in good health despite what many outlets were publishing. We’re back with our second installment of voicemails and these are some good ones.

Staying in music (kind of) does Jay Z have an unclaimed son? Speaking of sons, Robert De Niro at the young age of 79 is having another child…this leads to a wild one-liner from Demaris. We react to Doja Cat’s recent tweets and give props to the Knicks for fighting for another game. Stay till the end as we introduce our new VOICEMAIL segment.

MGK responds to Jack Harlow and Rory is forced to choose a side. Chris Brown and Usher allegedly had an altercation over the weekend in Vegas, while Diddy and Jermaine Dupree may have agreed to terms for a Verzuz. We discuss A.I. technology and how much we would hate the A.I. versions of ourselves. Spreadie Gibbs was the best thing trending over the weekend. We react to that interesting situation. We end with music and discuss Ed’s big win for the whites, Armani White’s album, and Conway’s album. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this, as well as the NBA playoffs. Are the Knicks a lost cause? And will Anthony Davis stay healthy?',

NY had a big week with the Met Gala so we took it upon ourselves to review the cat-themed fits. Somehow this turned into us reminiscing on our favorite old cartoons. We come back to current events and discuss the writer's strike, Roy Woods Jr. White House Correspondent speech and Ed Sheeran’s bold move if he doesn’t win. Staying on lawsuits, Frank Ocean is not happy with one fan in particular. Meanwhile, Brent Faiyaz inks a big pay day. Demaris claims Ice Spice has no talent which leads to a debate.

Rory doesn’t know it yet, but we have a surprise party planned for him (it’s okay, he doesn’t read the descriptions). Anyway, Mal was bumping knees court-side with Jack Harlow at the Knicks game. Sadly, only Jack was fortunate enough to have Kyle Lowry jump on his lap. Let’s stay on Jack (pause) we give our review of his album and then discuss him self-proclaiming as the “hardest whiteboy in rap.” Mal reverts back to last week’s episode and calls Rory out for his Doja/J Cole take. In other music news, Ed Sheeran is facing a lawsuit against Marvin Gaye’s estate. Meanwhile false rumors about Coi Leray and Latto surface over the weekend from the Something in The Water Festival. This leads to a heated discussion about Cardi B and her Grammy win / her career as an artist. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this, as well as, DaBaby remaining canceled, the NBA Playoffs (we rank our top 5) + more!",

While they figure out how to shape their careers, Kendrick is in full stride after grossing the highest rap tour. Then we put our conspiracy cap on after Tucker Carlson’s response video. Is he still working with Fox? In sad news we lost a daytime tv legend, Jerry Springer. We reminisce on some of the craziest moments in his show’s history. Like setting up the KKK to get in a fight.

In other disappointing concert news, Frank Ocean left everyone at Coachella upset after many technical problems and turning his set into karaoke. Speaking of karaoke, is it hip-hop for Usher to give 21 Savage a mic to sing? Even worse, is it hip-hop for Rory to DM Drake laughing emojis and never get a response? Friendships tend to come to a close which is also the case for Ja Rule and Billy McFarland. Did you hear about the woman that claimed to have hooked up with 6 guys a day for a week? This leads into a conversation about the double standard between men and women and of course high school bleachers get involved.

        'Happy Friday to everyone that joined the Bare Minumum Club. Today is the last day the shirts will be available. Get yours before the sale ends! Now let’s talk about Coachella. Who keeps booking A$AP Rocky as a headliner? Let’s stay on music and discuss the new albums from Daniel Caesar & Rae Sremmurd. Is Daniel Caesar still canceled and why’d he call out Rory like that? and the Dalai Lama still on the loose? Speaking of tongue sucking, Nick Cannon says he should have his next child with Taylor Swift. Since the simulation seems to be simulating let’s talk about how men are getting fake abs (even some of your favorite artists). Meanwhile, Woah Vicky calls out Lil Nas X for faking his sexuality (the irony). *Trigger Warning* we discuss how a man was moved to commit suicide after chatting with an AI bot. Tune in as the guys discuss all of this, as well as, the downfall of CNN+, Justin Timberlake making black people music again, new shows to watch, + more!',
